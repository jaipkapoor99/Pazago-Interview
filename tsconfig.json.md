# tsconfig.json Explained

This file is the TypeScript configuration file for the project. It specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

## compilerOptions

This section specifies the compiler options.

- `target`: The version of ECMAScript to target. `ES2021` is a recent version of ECMAScript.
- `lib`: The libraries to include in the compilation. `dom`, `dom.iterable`, and `es2021` are included.
- `allowJs`: Whether to allow JavaScript files to be compiled. This is set to `false`.
- `skipLibCheck`: Whether to skip type checking of declaration files. This is set to `true`.
- `strict`: Whether to enable all strict type-checking options. This is set to `true`.
- `noEmit`: Whether to not emit output files. This is set to `true` because Next.js handles the compilation.
- `esModuleInterop`: Whether to enable interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules. This is set to `true`.
- `module`: The module system to use. `ESNext` is used.
- `moduleResolution`: The module resolution strategy. `Node` is used.
- `baseUrl`: The base directory to resolve non-absolute module names.
- `paths`: A series of entries which re-map imports to lookup locations relative to the `baseUrl`.
- `resolveJsonModule`: Whether to include modules imported with `.json` extension. This is set to `true`.
- `isolatedModules`: Whether to ensure that each file can be safely transpiled without relying on other imports. This is set to `true`.
- `jsx`: The JSX factory function to use. `preserve` is used to keep the JSX as part of the output to be further processed by another transformer (e.g. Babel).
- `incremental`: Whether to enable incremental compilation. This is set to `true`.
- `types`: The type definitions to include in the compilation. `node` and `jest` are included.
- `plugins`: A list of plugins to load. The `next` plugin is used.
- `allowImportingTsExtensions`: Whether to allow importing `.ts` and `.tsx` files. This is set to `true`.

## include

This section specifies the files to be included in the compilation.

- `**/*.ts`: All TypeScript files.
- `**/*.tsx`: All TypeScript with JSX files.
- `next-env.d.ts`: The Next.js environment declaration file.
- `.next/types/**/*.ts`: The Next.js generated type files.

## exclude

This section specifies the files to be excluded from the compilation.

- `node_modules`: The `node_modules` directory.
