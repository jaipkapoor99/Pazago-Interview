The mantra—making exporting as seamless as e-commerce—now anchors the roadmap and keeps the whole company aimed at predictability, transparency, and scale.

## Provue: In-Depth Product Analysis 🛠️

### What is Provue.ai?

Provue.ai is an emerging **free AI-powered finance platform** transforming financial research for the Indian market. It converts complex financial documents into actionable insights, audiobooks, and structured workflows, enabling investors to make faster, more informed decisions. The platform addresses the critical pain point of information overload from earnings reports, IPO documents, and financial statements.

### Core Features and Functionality

Actions enable users to run **structured stock or IPO analyses instantly**. This feature allows for on-demand deep dives into specific companies, breaking down financial information into digestible, actionable segments.

**Context (Memory Feature)** 🗂️

Context is Provue's personalized intelligence layer—a **memory system that builds user-specific knowledge**. It remembers previous analyses and preferences, allowing users to upload documents to create a persistent knowledge base for the AI to reference.

**Studio (Audio Generation)** 🎙️

Studio **converts research materials into podcasts or audiobooks** in multiple languages, including regional Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi). It uses high-quality Indian voice clarity to create two-voice conversational podcasts from prompts, links, or documents in one click.
