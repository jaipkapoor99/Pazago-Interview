## Leadership & Founding Story 🎯

### Founder: Nikhil Agrawal 🌟

- I observed that you’re a Y Combinator alumnus (W21) and a three-time startup founder.
- I found the following past roles particularly relevant:
  - I noticed your 2020 stint at Credit Karma as a Software Engineer on an iOS app serving 85+ million users.
  - I saw that you co-founded Alinea in 2020-2021, served as CTO, hit 30% MoM growth, and shipped the first product in 31 days.

### Your Vision 🔭

I learned that you built Pazago after repeatedly hearing exporters describe global trade as unnecessarily complex, unpredictable, and friction-filled. You want to replace relationship-driven manual processes with structured, data-driven systems. I appreciated how you and the founding crew spent months shadowing exporters, mapping every workflow before touching code so the platform could flex to the industry’s messy realities. Your mantra—making exporting “as seamless as e-commerce”—now anchors the roadmap and keeps the whole company aimed at predictability, transparency, and scale.

### Leadership Philosophy 🤝

I appreciate your belief that every team member should feel like a stakeholder: move fast, iterate, take calculated risks, and challenge the status quo.

### Broader Leadership Bench 👥

- I noted you have Kanika Sharma Batra steering director-level operations after her years inside Globelink’s Africa tradelane—useful when conversations drift to pricing nuance and freight partnerships.
- I saw Neeraj Chelawat joining you at the director level, bringing DHL and Safmarine scale experience plus recent startup grit from S H Logistics.
- I mapped the folks around you—Ayushi Khandhar in your office, Bhargav Chaudhari pushing Provue’s AI stack, and Shilpa Makasare minding people ops—so I know who to loop in when deeper dives come up.

### Funding & Investors 💸

- I logged the $3.5M seed round you closed with General Catalyst India leading the charge and YC W21 giving you that alumni halo.
- I keep the YC context in mind—remote batch, 350+ companies, 43 from India—because it frames the network you can tap for talent and distribution.
- I track General Catalyst’s $40B+ AUM footprint and applied-AI thesis since it mirrors the direction you’re steering Provue.
- I bookmarked the +198 Mosaic score bump CB Insights flagged this month so I can cite third-party momentum if capital strategy comes up.
