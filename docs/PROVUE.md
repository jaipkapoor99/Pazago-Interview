## Leadership & Founding Story 🎯

### Founder: Nikhil Agrawal 🌟

- I observed that you’re a Y Combinator alumnus (W21) and a three-time startup founder.
- I found the following past roles particularly relevant:
  - I noticed your 2020 stint at Credit Karma as a Software Engineer on an iOS app serving 85+ million users.
  - I saw that you co-founded Alinea in 2020-2021, served as CTO, hit 30% MoM growth, and shipped the first product in 31 days.
  - I noted your participation in the On Deck Fellowship (ODF 11).
- I recorded your academic background as a Bachelor’s in Business Management from Jain (Deemed-to-be University) between 2013 and 2016, a Business Management program at King’s College London during 2016-2017, and a Master’s in Computer Science from Northeastern University completed in 2021.

### Your Vision 🔭

I learned that you built Pazago after repeatedly hearing exporters describe global trade as unnecessarily complex, unpredictable, and friction-filled. You want to replace relationship-driven manual processes with structured, data-driven systems. Your mantra—making exporting as seamless as e-commerce—now anchors the roadmap and keeps the whole company aimed at predictability, transparency, and scale.

### Leadership Philosophy 🤝

I appreciate your belief that every team member should feel like a stakeholder: move fast, iterate, take calculated risks, and challenge the status quo.

### Funding & Investors 💸

Pazago is backed by General Catalyst and Y Combinator (W21).

## Provue: In-Depth Product Analysis 🛠️

### What is Provue.ai?

Provue.ai is an emerging **free AI-powered finance platform** transforming financial research for the Indian market. It converts complex financial documents into actionable insights, audiobooks, and structured workflows, enabling investors to make faster, more informed decisions. The platform addresses the critical pain point of information overload from earnings reports, IPO documents, and financial statements.

### Core Features and Functionality

**Playbooks** 📘

Playbooks provide **5-minute distilled wisdom** from financial experts. These pre-built templates turn complex data into clear action plans for company earnings analysis, market insights, and strategic frameworks.

**Actions** ⚡

Actions enable users to run **structured stock or IPO analyses instantly**. This feature allows for on-demand deep dives into specific companies, breaking down financial information into digestible, actionable segments.

**Context (Memory Feature)** 🗂️

Context is Provue's personalized intelligence layer—a **memory system that builds user-specific knowledge**. It remembers previous analyses and preferences, allowing users to upload documents to create a persistent knowledge base for the AI to reference.

**Studio (Audio Generation)** 🎙️

Studio **converts research materials into podcasts or audiobooks** in multiple languages, including regional Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi). It uses high-quality Indian voice clarity to create two-voice conversational podcasts from prompts, links, or documents in one click.

**James (AI Assistant)** 🤖

James is Provue's conversational AI assistant for earnings analysis and interactive queries. Users can chat with James for instant insights, applying expert frameworks to their investment strategies.

### Key Differentiators

**Speed and Efficiency** ⏱️

Provue's primary differentiator is **time compression**, reducing hours of research into minutes by automating the extraction, analysis, and synthesis of financial information.

**Audio Content Generation** 🎧

The Studio feature's ability to **convert financial research into podcasts and audiobooks** is unique, catering to users who prefer auditory learning.

**Zero Cost** 💰

Being **completely free** positions Provue.ai as an accessible alternative to expensive research platforms, removing financial barriers for retail investors.

**Context Retention** 🧠

The platform's **memory feature (Context)** creates a personalized research environment that learns from user interactions and maintains continuity across sessions.

### Comparison with Competitors

In the Indian financial research space, Provue.ai competes with established platforms like:

- **Screener.in**: Known for reliability but lacks AI-powered analysis and audio features.
- **Trendlyne**: Offers AI-based stock screeners but requires paid subscriptions for advanced features.
- **MarketSmith India**: Provides CANSLIM-based AI models focused on growth stock identification.

Provue distinguishes itself by combining **stock screening, earnings analysis, IPO evaluation, audio content creation, and personalized memory** in a single free platform.
