# Journey to Provue Demo

This whole effort began with a shrug and a blank folder. If I could cobble together a small demo that felt like Provue, maybe the interview would go smoother. So I skimmed the JD, glanced at `PAZAGO.md`, and told myself that running both Fastify and Express at the same time wasn’t overkill—it was “architectural curiosity.” A Next.js homepage followed because it’s hard to talk about insight dashboards without anything on screen. Postgres joined the party simply because it felt wrong to fake data with an array while pretending to build something serious.

From there the repo evolved in fits and starts. Whenever a script barked at me, I added it to `package.json` and kept it around. Migrations and seeds appeared after I realized empty tables ruin demos faster than a broken build. A README happened in self-defense; future-me can only thank past-me for leaving breadcrumbs. Documentation in `docs/` quietly multiplied so I could remember why any of this exists.

Somewhere along the way it all started looking suspiciously professional. GitHub Actions now greet every push, formatting and linting run like clockwork, and Postgres hums along on the latest version. Dependency updates no longer feel reckless, just maintenance. Somehow the thing actually compiles, serves reasonable data, and has a story behind it.

So that’s the journey: a half-baked idea that accidentally became a tidy little demo, ready to be pitched on interview day. Not a bad outcome for an exercise that started with “let me wing it for a minute.”\*\*\*
